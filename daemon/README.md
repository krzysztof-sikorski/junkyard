# Daemon 2

Remake of my friend’s “Daemon” browser game, created somewhere in year 2013,
some time after the original author shot down the original edition.

The game was running on cheap shared hosting and did not use any special
configuration like `.htaccess` files, so URLs were mapped 1:1 to PHP files.

For some unexplained reason I also decided to not use any framework,
but write all boilerplate from scratch instead.
The only third-party library used in project is the PHPTAL templating engine.

The original README is preserved
in [README-original.md](README-original.md) file.
