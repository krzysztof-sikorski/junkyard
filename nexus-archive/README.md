# Nexus Archive

An abandoned third-party website for the Nexus Clash PBBG.

My intention was aggregate public information about game world
(players, characters, factions, map, leaderboards, etc) by automatically
tracking and storing my network usage while I play the game.

Development started somewhere in year 2021.
Unfortunately only leaderboard parser was actually implemented
before I lost interest in the project.
